# Traffic Camera Tracking: Escooter

Main goals of this project is to track escooters, pedestrians and cyclists through a traffic intersection and record informations regarding their time of passing and the directions. This project is a part of **SaveNoW**, where all these details are used to create a digital twin of Ingolstadt for simulation purposes.

So far only escooters have been taken into account of this project. When all the code works, it won't be difficult to retrain the model with enough annotations of cyclists and pedestrians and modify a few lines of code to accomodate them.
